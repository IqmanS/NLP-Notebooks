Are we alone in the universe?\nIs there alien life out there? What is the future of the human race?\nUp until the 1920s, everyone thought the universe was essentially static and unchanging in time.\nThen it was discovered that the universe was expanding. Distant galaxies were moving away from us.\nThis meant they must have been closer together in the past. If we extrapolate back, \nwe find we must have all been on top of each other about 15 billion years ago. \nThis was the Big Bang, the beginning of the universe. But was there anything before the Big Bang?\nIf not, what created the universe? Why did the universe emerge from the Big Bang the way it did?\nWe used to think that the theory of the universe could be divided into two parts. \nFirst, there were the laws like Maxwell’s equations and general relativity that determined the\nevolution of the universe, given its state over all of the space at one time. And second, \nthere was no question of the initial state of the universe. We have made good progress on the\nfirst part, and now have the knowledge of the laws of evolution in all but the most extreme conditions.\nBut until recently, we have had little idea about the initial conditions for the universe.\"\"\"","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-07-01T14:25:12.580914Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-07-01T14:25:12.581246Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-07-01T14:25:12.595607Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-07-01T14:25:12.581220Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-07-01T14:25:12.594375Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 1.
